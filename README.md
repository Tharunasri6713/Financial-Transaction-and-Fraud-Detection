# Financial Transaction Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent financial transactions using a Machine Learning model (Random Forest) and compare its performance with a simple Rule-Based approach.

## 📘 Overview
The system analyzes transaction data to identify suspicious activities in real-time. It focuses on improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms. The project also includes comparison with a rule-based model to highlight the improvement offered by machine learning.

## 🧠 Features
- Detects fraudulent transactions using Random Forest  
- Compares performance with a rule-based system  
- Visualizes results with confusion matrix and performance metrics  
- Uses simulated transaction data for demonstration  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
